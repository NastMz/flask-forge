# üöÄ Forge CLI Release Automation

This set of scripts completely automates the development and release process for forge-cli, eliminating manual errors and ensuring a consistent workflow.

## üìÅ Included Files

- **`scripts/forge_release.py`** - Main script with all automation functions
- **`release.py`** - Simple and easy-to-use wrapper script
- **`RELEASE_GUIDE.md`** - This documentation

## üéØ Quick Usage

### Option 1: Simple Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive mode (guided step by step)
python release.py

# Direct commands
python release.py feature add-auth-command    # Start new feature
python release.py patch                       # Prepare patch release
python release.py minor                       # Prepare minor release
python release.py major                       # Prepare major release
python release.py publish                     # Create final release
```

### Option 2: Full Script (Advanced)

```bash
python scripts/forge_release.py start-feature <name>
python scripts/forge_release.py prepare-release <patch|minor|major>
python scripts/forge_release.py create-release
python scripts/forge_release.py full-release <patch|minor|major>  # Emergency only
```

## üìã Automated Workflow

### üåü 1. Start New Feature

```bash
python release.py feature my-new-feature
```

**What does it do automatically?**

- ‚úÖ Verifies that the working directory is clean
- ‚úÖ Switches to `main` branch if you're not on it
- ‚úÖ Runs `git pull origin main` to get latest changes
- ‚úÖ Creates and switches to new branch `feature/my-new-feature`

### üîß 2. Development (Manual)

- Implement your feature
- Pre-commit hooks run automatically
- Make commits normally: `git commit -m "feat: description"`

### üì¶ 3. Prepare Release

```bash
python release.py patch    # For bug fixes (1.0.1 ‚Üí 1.0.2)
python release.py minor    # For new features (1.0.1 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
python release.py major    # For breaking changes (1.0.1 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
```

**What does it do automatically?**

- ‚úÖ Gets current version from `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
- ‚úÖ Calculates new version according to semantic versioning
- ‚úÖ Updates both files with the new version
- ‚úÖ Runs all quality checks:
  - Linting with `ruff check .`
  - Formatting with `black --check .`
  - Tests with `pytest -q`
  - Version synchronization
- ‚úÖ Builds package with `python -m build`
- ‚úÖ Validates metadata with `twine check`
- ‚úÖ Verifies that templates are included
- ‚úÖ Commits version changes

### üîÑ 4. Create Pull Request (Manual)

```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

Then create the PR on GitHub. CI automatically:

- ‚úÖ Runs all quality checks
- ‚úÖ Validates package build
- ‚úÖ Verifies that templates are included

### üöÄ 5. Publish Release

**After the PR is approved and merged:**

```bash
python release.py publish
```

**What does it do automatically?**

- ‚úÖ Verifies you're on `main` branch
- ‚úÖ Verifies directory is clean
- ‚úÖ Runs `git pull origin main`
- ‚úÖ Runs final quality checks
- ‚úÖ Builds and validates final package
- ‚úÖ Creates tag `vX.Y.Z`
- ‚úÖ Pushes tag to GitHub
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions automatically publishes to PyPI

## ‚ö° Interactive Mode

For users less familiar with command line:

```bash
python release.py
```

The script will guide you step by step with interactive menus.

## üõ°Ô∏è Automatic Quality Checks

All scripts automatically run these verifications:

### üîç Code Checks

- **Ruff**: Linting and problem detection
- **Black**: Code formatting verification
- **Pre-commit**: Automatic hooks on each commit

### üìã Project Checks

- **Version synchronization**: `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` match
- **Build**: Package builds correctly
- **Metadata**: Validation with twine
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates are included in the wheel

### üåø Git Checks

- **Clean directory**: No uncommitted changes
- **Correct branch**: Operations on appropriate branches
- **Synchronization**: Latest repository state

## üö® Emergency Commands

### Full Release (No PR)

```bash
python scripts/forge_release.py full-release patch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This creates a release immediately without PR review. For emergencies only.

### Manual Checks

```bash
# Only check quality without changes
ruff check .
black --check .
python scripts/check_version_sync.py

# Only build and validate
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

## üîß Required Configuration

### Dependencies

The scripts require these dependencies (already in `pyproject.toml`):

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "rich>=13.7",      # For colorful output
    "requests",        # For GitHub API interactions
    "typer>=0.12",     # Already included in project
]
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)

For advanced GitHub functionality:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"  # For advanced GitHub API operations
```

## üìä Complete Session Example

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
$ python release.py feature add-json-output
‚úì Feature branch 'feature/add-json-output' created and checked out

# 2. Develop (manual)
# ... implement feature ...
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "feat: add JSON output option to forge commands"

# 3. Prepare release
$ python release.py minor
Current version: 1.0.2
New version: 1.1.0
Update version from 1.0.2 to 1.1.0? [y/N]: y
‚Üí Running ruff check...
‚Üí Running black format check...
‚Üí Running tests...
‚Üí Checking version synchronization...
‚Üí Building package...
‚Üí Checking package metadata...
‚Üí Verifying templates are included...
‚úì Release prepared for version 1.1.0

# 4. Create PR and wait for merge (manual)
$ git push origin feature/add-json-output
# ... create PR, review, merge ...

# 5. Publish release
$ python release.py publish
‚úì Release v1.1.0 created successfully

GitHub Actions will now:
1. Run all quality checks
2. Build the package
3. Publish to PyPI automatically
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Working directory is not clean"

```bash
git status                    # See which files have changes
git add . && git commit -m "wip: save changes"  # Or
git stash                     # Save changes temporarily
```

### Error: "Version mismatch"

```bash
python scripts/check_version_sync.py  # See the problem
# Manually edit pyproject.toml or src/forge/__init__.py
```

### Error: "Command failed"

```bash
# See detailed error output
# The scripts show exactly which command failed and why
```

### Build or Test Errors

```bash
# Run manually to see details
python -m build
pytest -v
ruff check .
black --check .
```

## üé® Customization

### Modify Checks

Edit the `run_quality_checks()` function in `scripts/forge_release.py`:

```python
def run_quality_checks() -> None:
    # Add new checks here
    run_command("mypy src/")  # Example: add type checking
```

### Change Versioning Behavior

Modify the `bump_version()` function for different versioning schemes.

### Add New Commands

Extend the `release.py` script with new options in the `main()` function.

With these scripts, your development and release workflow is completely automated! üéâ
